# Hi there!

I'm Josh. Originally from Perth Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, I now live in Cambridge, UK :gb: and work in London. I moved to the UK in December, 2018 while my partner completes her PhD in Cancer Biology at Cambridge University in partnership with the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute.

I'm a Senior Platform Engineer at [CondÃ© Nast International](https://condenastinternational.com), working with Kubernetes, AWS, Go, Terraform, Datadog, Fastly, and an assortment of other tools and services. Previously, I was a Senior DevOps Engineer at [Bankwest](https://bankwest.com.au), where I was helping to build a Cloud Native Platform with Azure, AWS, and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

Occasionally I speak at tech events and meetups, you can see my various slide decks on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/jmickey).

I love [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/32368360), photography, and walking my adorable Shiba Inu #doge (see below for pics)! :dog2::heart:
